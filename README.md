Sunrise is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain that combines high-throughput data availability with a native liquidity hub. It integrates **Proof of Liquidity (PoL)** and **fee abstraction**, delivering immediate liquidity and flexible gas‑payment options to rollups and application chains. Validators secure the network by staking RISE and/or vRISE. Liquidity providers supply liquidity to pools and earn vRISE and trading fees. Sunrise interoperates with Rollup and L2 Blockchain, allowing developers to adopt Sunrise with minimal integration effort.
